    <h2>RootZ - Global Game Jam 2023</h2>
    <br>
    <p>I participated in GGJ23 at Northumbira Univeristy, the theme for this year was 'Roots'. Me and a team of 4 people
        created a game where the player is tasked to defend a house from invading roots that if left untouched will spawn
        small mandrakes that will attack the player. GGJ23 at Northumbria University was sponsored by Sumo Digital who
        awarded this as the 'Winning' entry.</p>
    <br>
    <p>My role in the team was to help create the perks, develop a perk management system and develop aspects of the player
        controller.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Rootz was developed using Unity.</p>

    <h2>Experimental Workspace - Dissertation</h2>
    <br>
    <p>To complete my bachelor degree in Computer Science I wrote research paper on the effects of performance tuning
    techniques used within games development. The purpose of this paper was to be able not only discuss these techniques
    but to create a space to be able to collect metrics and thoroughly analyse these effects on median frame time, upper
    quartile and lower quartile. This experimental workspace was created in Unity.</p>

    <h2>Gameshell - Software Architecture for Games</h2>
    <br>
    <p>For this module I was given a stripped down game engine in which I was tasked with developing this game engine out
    with level management functionality. This module was of great interest to me as it taught a multitude of concepts and
    allowed me to put this into practice. creating and understanding a game engine from scratch made me understand the
    importance of encapsulation and designing software with decoupled hierarchy. This module was focused upon C++.</p>

    <h2>Pier Scene - Computer Animation</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Using Three.js I was tasked to create a scene based on the techniques of graphics rendering and 3D modelling. To
    showcase my abilities in these areas I decided to create a scene consisting of a pier. The choice of this scene
    allowed for the display in my ability to create 3D models through modelling and geometry deformation with lighting,
        shadows and shading. This also allowed me to use ambient occlusion and roughness maps to create 3D effects on 2D
    textures. As an extra showcase of what I had learned during this module I made the decision to animate the ocean
    plane to have a wave effect which was a difficult challenge but based on the knowledge I had at the time, I was happy
    with the end result.</p>
